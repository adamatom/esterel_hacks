module Unbounded:
input A, B;
output O;
relation A # B;
loop % this presents an instantaneous loop
    present A then
        pause;
        emit O;
    end
end
% I didnt expect this to compile based on the primer and notes from ceu, but it does. The statemachine just does
% a noop, so I'm not sure

end module
